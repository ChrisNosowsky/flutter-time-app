# World Time App

A simple world time app I created to learn Flutter and the Dart programming lanaguage created by Google.

App uses class structuring, widget trees, promises and asynchronous functions to await the arrival of a world time API endpoint.

Uses graphics that are 8-bit/pokemon themed!

Currently only has a edit location mechanic and a list view to select from a variety of world locations.
